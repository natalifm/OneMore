                                <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far.
                                    Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to
                                    run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth
                                    more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you
                                    all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.

                                    <p>Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades,
                                        certificates and other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate,
                                        asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave
                                        positive reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos filed
                                        lawsuits against
                                        Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle

                                            <li><em>1997 ― </em>Began a multi-building development along the Hudson
                                                River, which was named Trump Place.
                                                Me and the other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was
                                                then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City
                                            </li>
                                            <li><em>1996 ― </em>Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was
                                                a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street.
                                                After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump
                                                Building️

                                                Circle,
                                                turned it into a 44-story luxury property known as Trump International
                                                Hotel and Tower️

                                            <li><em>1989 - 1992 ― </em>Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle.
                                                What a waste of money,
                                                I had to sell it, now it is American Airlines Shuttle, btw
                                            </li>
                                            <li><em>1989, 1990 ― </em>Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold
                                                my very own Tour de Trump.
                                                Is America not great enough for that cycling competition?️

                                            <li><em>1988 ― </em>Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million,
                                                invested $50 million to restore the building and boosted it from
                                                three-star to four-star hotel
                                                (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)

                                            <li><em>1985 ― </em>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned
                                                it into a private club.
                                                You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another
                                                annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich).
                                                That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana
                                                became a manager, because she is another Trump!

                                            <li><em>1983 ― </em>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football
                                                team. I changed team's play schedule and filed an antitrust lawsuit
                                                against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now,
                                                but back then they were great!

                                            <li><em>1980 ― </em>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in
                                                Manhattan,
                                                I payed a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic
                                                Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features.
                                                All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that
                                                the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space
                                                to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also
                                                started a repair
                                                job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three
                                                months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial
                                                budget!
